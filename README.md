# demo project

This is a simple React demo project created with vite.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## React Router
This project uses react router. Check out the tutorial at: https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial


## The Server!

The `<Names>` component in this project needs access to an API. That API
is powered by the [demo-server project](https://github.com/bradmontgomery/demo-server/)

Hint: This is sneaky little edit. Whoo!
